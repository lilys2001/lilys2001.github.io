                    <h4 class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Introduction</h4>
                    <p class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Throughout middle school and high school, we are shuffled into our counselor's office every spring to schedule our classes for the next year. The selections are then collected and manually inputted into the school's database by our counselors. Ideally, each student is successfully placed into all their desired classes, but this is often not the case. Instead, they face scheduling conflicts and classroom capacity limits. The process is tedious, for both the students and the counselors, and the results are unsatisfactory.</p>

                    <h4 class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Goals</h4>
                    <p class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">With our project, we aimed to solve this issue by leveraging the ease and efficiency of technology. We simplified the course scheduling process down to three simple steps: the counselor inputs the available classes for the next year, the teachers select the classes they want to teach and which periods they want their breaks, and then the students choose the classes they want to enroll in. The data would then be processed by our program to create the most ideal master schedule and course schedule for each student and teacher.</p>

                    <h4 class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Approach</h4>
                    <p class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">For our project, we chose to use Google Forms because we thought they were an accessible and straightforward method of collecting responses. We created a form that would ask for the maximum number of students allowed to enroll in each section of a class, the number of periods in a day, and the departments and the classes taught by each department. We were then able to write a Google Apps Script that would automatically generate an "Instructor Class Selection Form" to be sent out to all teachers. The teachers would select their break times and the classes they were willing to teach. After all responses are received, we had another Google Apps Script parse the data to create the "Student Course Request Form", which allowed each student, identified by their id, to select the classes they wanted to enroll in. Finally, after all responses are collected, the data was saved as a CSV file to be parsed by our Python program</p>
                    <p class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">The program parsed the CSV data and created the corresponding objects (courses, sections, teachers, and students). Then, to create the master schedule of class times, teachers, and students, the program would first choose a teacher to teach the class and the number of sections that would be available, based on student interest and maximum class capacity. It would then assign each section to a different available period in the teachers schedule and in the master schedule. After all class times are decided, students are enrolled into their selected classes. If a class the student has selected is full or does not fit into their schedule, the program noted this and enrolled them into an available class in the same period if possible. After all students are enrolled in as many classes as possible, we looked at the total number of instances where a student did not receive their desired class.</p>

                    <h4 class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Challenges, Conclusion, & Future Improvements</h4>
                    <p class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Because we worked on this project after only half a semester of computer science classes in college, we had a lot of difficulty finding an efficient algorithm. We also were not able to properly connect all parts of the product, so the results of the Google Forms had to be manually downloaded and run through our Python program. However, now with much more experience, I think these are some problems we can better tackle. We used Google Forms in our project to collect information because it was a platform most people were familiar with, but with more time, we could build our own portal to collect the information and output the student, teacher, and master schedules, rather than having someone manually download the data files and run the program on them.</p>
                    <p class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Although the program seems to work with the tests we provided, it is definitely not the most optimal, in both results and efficiency. I think that we could improve the program, which we defined as minimizing the number of instances where students did not receive their desired class, by randomizing the order of the data a few times and taking the output that had the least number of misses. At the end of this project, we concluded that the problem of assigning students to classes seemed to be NP-hard.</p>
                    <p class = "wow fadeInUp" data-wow-duration = "1s">Overall, I think this was a really fun project that, with a lot more work, could definitely be useful for middle and high school counselors. Because this was my first large, non-schoolwork project, I really enjoyed learning how to structure a project and manage my time.</p>
